# C.T.Co Front-end task

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3, for the sole purpose of submitting it to C.T.Co for front-end job.

* Some testing coverage is available, so please feel free to run `ng test` & `ng e2e`
* Inspired by Angular docs, TypeScript docs, own knowledge, and PHP flashbacks

You obviously know it, but you have to `git clone` this to your stations first, and then install packages with `npm` or `yarn` whichever you're using.

## Development server

Run `ng serve --open` for a dev server which will automatically open in your default browser (yay!). 


## Testing

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests.

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end.
